Fragrance to Fire â€“ Dunsin Oyekan (Original)

Chorus
First it was fragrance
Then it turned to fire

My worship is my weapon
That is how you win your battle

Verse 1
The fragrance of my worship
Rose up to the Father

Noises, Thunderings, Earthquakes

Were the response to my worship

Verse 2
This is how I win, win, win
This is how I win

The smoke of my worship
Released upon the earth

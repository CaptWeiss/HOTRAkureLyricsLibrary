Praise - Elevation Worship (Original)

Bridge
Let everything
that has breath

praise the Lord
praise the Lord

Verse 1
I'll praise  the valley
Praise on the mountain

I'll praise when I'm sure
Praise when I'm doubting

I'll praise when outnumbered
Praise when surrounded

'Cause praise is the water
My enemies drown in

Chorus
As long as I'm breathing
I've got a reason to

Praise the Lord
Oh my soul

Verse 2
I'll praise when I feel it
And I'll praise when I don't

I'll praise 'cause I know
You're still in control

Because my praise is a weapon
It's more than a sound

my praise is the shout
That brings Jericho down

Verse 3
I won't be quiet, my God is alive
So how could I keep it inside?

Praise the Lord
Oh my soul

Verse 4
I'll praise 'cause You're sovereign
Praise 'cause You reign

Praise 'cause You rose and defeated the grave

I'll praise 'cause You're faithful
Praise 'cause You're true

Praise 'cause there's nobody greater than You

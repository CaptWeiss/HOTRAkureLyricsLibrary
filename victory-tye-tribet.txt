VICTORY - TYE TRIBET (ORIGINAL)

Verse 1
I thought I lost
But actually I won

For by His blood 
we all have overcome

There is no failure
Our God can never lose

And that same power 
It now belongs to You

Chorus
Now it's time to celebrate all banners raised
I've got the Victory The Victory

Because the devil is defeated and God be praised
I've got the Victory The Victory

Every situation I face 
I win

I've got the Victory The Victory
And everything works for my good in the end

I've got the Victory The Victory

VERSE 2
I was on 
my way to a burning hell

The devil 
He had my life set up to fail

But thanks be to my God who causes me

To triumph 
Overcome 
Tread upon the enemy

Verse 3
Somebody who's listening

Right now 
You think You're losing

You feel like You can't win
Cause You tried everything

Greater is He
That is within You

Don't doubt
Cause whatever You're in now

God says You have to come out

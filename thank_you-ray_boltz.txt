Thank You - Ray Boltz (Original)

Verse 1
I dreamed I went to Heaven
you were there with me

We walked upon the streets of gold
beside the Crystal Sea.

We heard the angels singing
then someone called your name

You turned and saw this young man
and he was smiling as he came

He said, "Friend you may not know me now," and then he said, "But wait -

You used to teach my Sunday School
when I was only eight

And every week you would say a prayer
before the class would start

And one day when you said that prayer
I asked Jesus in my heart

Chorus
Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am a life that was changed

Thank you for giving to the Lord
I am so glad you gave

Verse 2
Then another man stood before you
he said "Remember the time

A missionary came to your church
His pictures made you cry

You didn't have much money but you gave it anyway

Jesus took that gift you gave
And that's why I'm in Heaven today

Verse 3
One by one they came
far as your eyes could see

Each life somehow touched
by your generosity

Little things that you had done
sacrifices that you made

They were unnoticed on this earth
In Heaven now proclaimed

Verse 4
And I know up in Heaven you're not supposed to cry

But I am almost sure there were tears in your eyes

As Jesus took your hand
and you stood before the Lord

He said "My child look around you
Great is your reward

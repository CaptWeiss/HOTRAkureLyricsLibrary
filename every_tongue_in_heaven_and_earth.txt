Every tongue in heaven and earth shall declare your glory - Ron Kenoly

Verse 1
Blessing and honor, glory and power
Be unto the Ancient of Days

From every nation, all of creation
Bow before the Ancient of Days

Chorus
Every tongue in heaven and earth
Shall declare Your glory

Every knee shall bow at
Your throne in worship

You will be exalted, oh God
And Your kingdom shall not pass away

Oh Ancient of Days

Verse 2
Your kingdom shall reign over all the earth
Sing unto the Ancient of Days

For none can compare to Your matchless worth
Sing unto the Ancient of Days

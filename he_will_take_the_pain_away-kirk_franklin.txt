He'll take the pain away - Kirk Franklin (Original)

Chorus
He'll take the pain away
I know

He'll take the pain away

Verse 1
Though you been searching
For such a long time

Searching for hope
And some peace of mind

There's a friend
who will step in on time

He'll take the pain away

Vamp
You've been searching all of here
and all of there and all God can

take the pain away. And I tried him for my self, and ooooo
I'm a living witness that God will take the pain away

Verse 2
Hold on don't give up

If any man be in Jesus
He'll take the pain away

If any man be in Jesus brand new
He'll take the pain away

Outro
OoOooOoOoOo
He'll take the pain away

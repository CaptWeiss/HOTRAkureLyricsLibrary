Glory - Deitrick Haddon (Original)

Verse 1
Oh You, You get the glory
For everything You've done for me

And no man can take the glory
For all of the things You've done for me

Lord, I know that You're the One
And I know where my help comes from

comes from

Chorus
All glory and honor belongs to God
All glory and honor belongs to God

Bridge
It belongs to God
It belongs to God

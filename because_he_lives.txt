Because He lives

Verse 1
God sent His son, they called Him Jesus
He came to love, heal and forgive

He lived and died to buy my pardon
An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives

Chorus
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow
Because He lives, all fear is gone

Because I know He holds the future
And life is worth the living

Because He lives!

Verse 2
How sweet to hold a newborn baby
And feel the pride and joy he brings

But greater still the calm assurance
This child can face uncertain days because He Lives

Verse 3
And then one day, I'll cross the river
I'll fight life's final war with pain

And then, as death gives way to victory
I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives

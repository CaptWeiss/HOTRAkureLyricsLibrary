The Blessing - Bethel Music (Original)

Verse 1
The Lord bless you and keep you

Make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you

The Lord turn His face toward you

And give you peace


Chorus
Amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen

Bridge 1
May His favor be upon you
And a thousand generations

And your family and your children

And their children, and their children

Bridge 2
May His presence go before you
And behind you and beside you

All around you and within you
He is with you, He is with you

In the morning, in the evening
In your coming and your going

In your weeping and rejoicing
He is for you, He is for you

Outro
Always for you, He's for you
I know He is for you

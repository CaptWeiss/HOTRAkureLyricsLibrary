For Your Glory - Tasha Cobbs (Original)

Verse 1
Lord if I
Find favor in Your sight

Lord please
Hear my hearts cry

I'm desperately waiting
To be where You are

I'll cross the hottest desert
I'll travel near or far

Chorus
For Your glory

I will do anything

Just to see You
To behold You as my King

Vamp
I wanna be where You are
I gotta be where You are

I wanna be where You are
Peace is where You are

Joy is where You are
And Love is who You are

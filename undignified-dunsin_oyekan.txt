Undignified Excuse Me - Dunsin Oyekan (Original)

Verse 1
Many battles
Many struggles

But God has been there for me

Fighting for me
Winning for me

He has never lost a fight

The number of my scars
are the number of my victories

That's why my praise
Can never be the same as yours

Chorus
Excuse me
If I get undignified

You don't know
Like I know what He has done
For me

Vamp
I will sing
I will shout
I will dance

I will let them know
I will let them know

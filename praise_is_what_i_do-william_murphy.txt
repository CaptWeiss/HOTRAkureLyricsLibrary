Praise Is What I Do - William Murphy (Original)

Solo
Praise is what I do
When I want to be close to You

I lift my hands in praise

Praise is who I am
I will praise Him while I can

I'll bless Him at all times

Chorus
I vow to praise You
Through the good and the bad

I'll praise You
Whether happy or sad

I'll praise You
In all that I go through

Because praise is what I do

Cause I owe it all to You

Verse 1
Praise is what I do
Even when I am going through

I've learned to worship You

Though my circumstance doesn't even stand a chance

My praise out weighs the bad

Verse 2
Praise is what I do
When I want to be close to You

I lift my hands in praise
Praise is who I am

I will praise Him while I can
I'll bless Him at all times

Vamp
Praise is what I do

Is what I do

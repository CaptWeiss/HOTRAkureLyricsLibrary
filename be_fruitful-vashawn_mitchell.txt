Be Faithful - VaShawn Mitchell (Original)

Verse 1
God has a plan with you in mind
for you to be fruitful and multiply

He knows your ending, before your beginning
Don't be dismayed, its only delayed

Its not only your time
but your turn

Chorus
God's plan for you, shall come to pass
Just wait and see, you'll be alright

Bridge
Be fruitful, multiply

I speak blessings, on your life

I speak blessings

on your life

Outro
Multiply

Be fruitful and multiply

Its not only your time, but your turn

Every man for himself
But You never ever leave me alone

Everyday of my life
You dey show me so much Mercy and Grace

And I prayed
I prayed through all my days

Upon all the notice me wey I do
My matter don soft oo

My matter don bless 

And all the enemies wey no dey gbadu me

Until tomorrow
You have made them all my footstool

But first, You are my father

Also, You are willing

Holy night

Verse 1
Oh holy night
The stars are brightly shining

It is the night
Of our dear Savior's birth

Long lay the world
In sin and error pining

Till He appeared
and the soul felt it's worth

thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks

new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees

Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine

Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine

Oh night oh night divine

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand

Over by night a star is sweetly gleaming
It came the wisemen from out of the Orient land

The King of kings lay thus lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friends

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices

Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born

Oh night divine
Oh night oh night divine

Oh night divine
Oh night

Oh night divine

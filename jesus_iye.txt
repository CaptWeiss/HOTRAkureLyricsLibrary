Jesus Iye - Nathaniel Bassey (Original) 

Chorus
Jesus Iye
You Have Done It Again

Jesus Iye
In Your Special Way

What Was Impossible
You’ve Made Possible

Jesus Iye

Verse 1
I Almost Gave Up
When It Seemed It Was Impossible

When The Odds Were Up Against Me
And There Was No Way

It Seemed All Over
Then You Spoke Into The Dry Bones

What Was Impossible
You’ve Made Possible
Jesus Iye

Verse 2
I Almost Let Go
When The Violent Storm Was Raging

And The Night Was Long And Lonely
It Looked Like There Was No Hope

Then I Cried Out To You
And You Spoke Into The Darkness
“Let There Be Light”

What Was Impossible
You’ve Made Possible
Jesus Iye

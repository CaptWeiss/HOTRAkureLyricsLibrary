Goodness of God - Bethel Music (Original)

Verse 1
I love You Lord
For Your mercy never fails me

All my days
I've been held in Your hands

From the moment that I wake up
Until I lay my head

I will sing of the Goodness of God

Chorus
All my life You have been faithful

And all my life You have been so-so good

With every breath that I am able

I will sing of the goodness of God

Oh, I'm gonna sing of the goodness of God

Verse 2
I love Your voice
You have led me through the fire

In the darkest night 
You are close like no other

I've known You as a Father
I've known You as a Friend

And I have lived in the Goodness of God

Bridge
Your goodness is running after
It's running after me

With my life laid down
I'm surrendered now

I give You everything

All I want - James Fortune (Original)

Verse 1
We all want to feel accepted
And experience real love

When our own emotions try to convince us
That we'll never be good enough

No longer feeling like a mistake
Found by a grace that I can't escape 

Chorus
Jesus it's You

Who understands the language of my tears

The broken part of me that has been healed

Cause you're working on me
Cause you're working on me

Bridge
All I want is more, more
Of You Jesus

Don't take your love away
Don't take your love away
love away

Jesus it's You

Verse 2
No more favors
I don't need it

I'm so tired of all the lies
Will anyone go

The extra mile to
See this hurt that I had with a smile

No more excuses
No one to blame

I found a love that will never change

Verse 3
Who understands the language of my tears
The broken part of me that has been healed

Jesus it's You

Who understands the language of my tears
The broken part of me that has been healed

Cause you're working on me
Still working on me

Jesus it's You

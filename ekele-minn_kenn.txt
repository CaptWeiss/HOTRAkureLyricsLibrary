Ekele - Minn Kenn (Original)

Verse 1
Where would I be if not for Your grace?
Oh Lord I’ll praise You all of my days

I’m standing here today
Because You’ve shown me mercy

Where would I be without Your grace

Your goodness and Your love surround me
Your peace and favour go before me

I feel so undeserving
You say that I am worth it

Where would I be without Your grace

Pre-chorus 1
You have turned my mourning into dancing
dancing

You have turned my sorrow into joy
Over and over again

Chorus 1
Agam enye gi ekele imela

Chorus 2
Agam enye gi ekele imela
imela ah

Agam enye gi ekele imela ah

I’m gonna give You the praise

For You’ve done me well
done me well

Odogwu eh

Bridge
I have confidence
Your love will never fail me

You’re always thinking of me
Never fail me

You never fail me
Never fail me No!

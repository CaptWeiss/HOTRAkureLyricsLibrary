Now unto the lamb upon the throne
We raise a sound, we raise a sound

For he is God and God alone
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

We raise a sound, we raise a sound

From every nation, tribe and tongue
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

To receive glory, honor and praise

Now unto the lamb upon the throne
we raise a sound, we raise a sound

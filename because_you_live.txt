Because you live - Sinach (Original)

Verse 1
You paid the price
The highest price

I'm so grateful
For your love

You took my place
And now I stand

To be called your very own

Chorus
Because you live
Jesus I live

I have no fear
Of what tomorrow brings

Because you live
Jesus I live today

I live to praise your name

I live today 
I have no fear 

Of what tomorrow brings 
Because you live 

Jesus I live 
I live to praise your name

Chorus 2
I live to praise your name
I have no fear

Of what tomorrow bringsBecause you live 

Jesus I live 
I live to praise your name

Verse 1:
King of kings
Lord of lords

You reign, above all

So we sing Your name extol
You reign, above all

Say you Reign
You reign

we join the heavens now
to proclaim your majesty

Let everything that has breathe
join this chorus now

Chorus
You reign, You reign
Elohim you reign

Iye na na na na

Iye na na na na 
Iye Iye Iye

Our God - Micah Stampley

Verse 1
Water You turned into wine
Opened the eyes of the blind

There's no one like You
None like You

Into the darkness You shine
Out of the ashes we rise

There's no one like You
None like You

Chorus
Our God is greater
Our God is stronger

God, You are higher than any other

Our God is healer

Awesome in power
Our God, our God

Verse 2
Into the darkness You shine
Out of the ashes we rise

There's no one like You
None like You, none like You

Bridge
And if our God is for us
Then who can ever stop us

And if our God is with us
Then what can stand against

Ay, ay
Then what can stand against
Then what can stand against
Ay, ay, ay, ay

Great is thy faithfulness - Hymn

Verse 1
Great is Thy faithfulness
O God my Father

There is no shadow of turning with Thee

Thou changest not
Thy compassions they fail not

As Thou hast been
Thou forever wilt be

Chorus
Great is Thy faithfulness
Great is Thy faithfulness

Morning by morning New mercies I see

All I have needed 
Thy hand hath provided

Great is Thy faithfulness
Lord unto me

Verse 2
Summer and winter
Springtime and harvest

Sun moon and stars in Their courses above

Join with all nature in Manifold witness

To Thy great faithfulness mercy and love 

Verse 3
Pardon for sin and
A peace that endureth

Thine own dear presence To cheer and to guide

Strength for today and Bright hope for tomorrow

Blessings all mine with Ten thousand beside

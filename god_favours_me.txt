God favours me - Hezekiah walker (Original)

Verse 1
Love is patient, caring
Love is Kind

Love is felt most when
It's genuine

But I've had my share of love abused, manipulated
And it's strength misused

And I can't help but give you glory
When I think about my story 

And I know you favored me
Because my enemies
 
Did try but couldn't triumph over me

Yes they did try but couldn't triumph over me.

Chorus
They whispered, conspired, they told their lies 
God favors me

My character, my integrity, my faith in God 
He favors me

Will not fall, will not bend, won't compromise 
God favors me

I speak life and prosperity and I speak health 
God favors me

Bridge
Say Yes 
Yes 

God favors me

Yes 
Yes
God favors me

Verse 2
I don't know what you're going through
But I want you to know tonight

You got favor

God favors me

In your trial
In your test

In your hard times
Don't worry

God favors me

Attack your character
Attack your integrity

Don't worry no no
God favors me

Touch your neighbor
Encourage the person next to ya

Tell em I got it
Tell em I got it

And I can say yes
Yes

Thou yeah will
Say yes

Because I got

God favors me

Through my crises

Difficulties
Through my hard times

Yes Yes Yes 

God favors me

I found favor
I got it, I got it, I got it

You know what ya'll I got another witness

Wondering why I did not die
I'll be happy to tell you why

God favors me

No longer do I cry
When fake friends say goodbye

God favors me

Some days the well was dry
But I have the same reply

God favors me

Evil wants to bring me down inside
But God said again I rise

Thou Art A Shield For Me: Psalm 3 - Byron Cage (Original)

Verse 1
Lord, how are they increased that trouble me,
many are they that rise up against me.
Many there be which say of my soul,
there is no help for Him in God.

Chorus
But Thou, O Lord, art a shield for me;
my glory, You lift mine head.

But Thou, O Lord, art a shield for me;
my glory, the lifter up of mine head.

Verse 2
I cried unto the Lord with my voice,
and He heard me out of His holy hill.

I laid me down and slept;
I awaked; for the Lord sustained me.

Verse 3
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people,
that have set themselves against me round about.

I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people,
that have set themselves against me round about.


Vamp
Thank You for lifting,
thank You for lifting,

thank You for lifting mine head.

Amazing - Dunsin Oyekan (Original)

Verse 1
You speak from heaven
We call it thunder
You are amazing

You smile from heaven
We call it rainbow
You are amazing

You look from heaven
We call it sunshine
That's amazing

And you made me
In your likeness
Super amazing

Chorus
You are amazing God
You are amazing

You are amazing God
You amaze me!

Verse 2
Your eyes are full of love
And it's overwhelming
Pouring down as rain

And you evident presence
All over blowing as the wind

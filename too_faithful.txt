Too faithful - Moses Bliss (Original)

Verse 1
You are who You are yesterday
Today and forever more

What You say is what You do
You never fail, You never change

You are faithful till the end
Faithful God, I worship you

I worship you

Chorus
You're too faithful to fail me
You're too faithful to disappoint me

You've proven Yourself in my life
And I've come to realize

You're too faithful to fail me

Verse 2
You're too loving to leave me
You're too loving to leave me halfway

What you start, You always finish
But I've come to realize

That You're too loving to leave me

Verse 3
You are too committed to leave me
oh Jesus

You're too consistent to leave me halfway

What you start, You always finish
And I've come to realize

That You're too faithful to fail me

What you start
You always finish

Lord, I'm here to testify
You're too faithful to fail me

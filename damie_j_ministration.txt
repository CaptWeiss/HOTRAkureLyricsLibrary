You have rescued my life

And I'm never going back

Hallelujah

You're my redeemer
Hallelujah

Atire tire o (kaabo)
Atire tire o (kaabo)

We've been expecting You (Welcome)
We've been expecting You (Welcome)

King of Zion, mighty ruler
Root of Jesse
We welcome You

Verse 6
There’s no shadow You won’t light up
Mountain You won’t climb up
Coming after me

There’s no wall You won’t kick down
Lie You won’t tear down
Coming after me

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights ‘til I’m found, leaves the ninety-nine

I couldn’t earn it, I don’t deserve it, still You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
